## ðŸ‘€ Overview

**ECPE-Qwen** leverages zero-shot instruction construction and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to improve large language models (LLMs) in Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE).

Using numeric identifier-style zero-shot instructions and a global text perspective, **ECPE-Qwen** jointly fine-tunes the Qwen1.5 model, enhancing performance in emotion, cause, and emotion-cause pair extraction. Results show it outperforms existing methods, with the 1.8B model reaching GPT-3.5 levels.
